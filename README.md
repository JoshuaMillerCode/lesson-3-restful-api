# Project Setup

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project and get it running locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```
### 2. Create a .env File
In the root directory of the project, create a .env file and add the following variables:

```js
PORT=<your-port-number>
API_KEYS=["key1", "key2", "key3"]
```
- PORT: This is the port number on which your application will run (e.g., 3000).
- API_KEYS: An array of valid API keys that your app can use for external services.
### 3. Start the Application
After setting up the .env file and installing the dependencies, you can run the application using:

```bash
npm run dev
```
